TODO
====

- data consistency check method (correctness of text-only references, something?) to be executed on loading (and saving?) of json files

- db statt json für aktuelle daten (json nur noch für import / export) -> sollte auch performance stark verbessern...
    -> Danach kann ich wohl die Parcelable-Methoden entfernen (again)
- Possibility to refer to other recipies within a recipe (or a subcategory for "partial recipes")? E.g. Salat within "Pommes + Cordon-Bleu" -> dependencies?
- Possibility to add a picture to a recipe (-> can I save these in json? Or how to do this technically? Save in db should work, but otherwise?)

- Option in Go Shopping to set marked items as invisible -> add chk_box on the other side of the spinner on top
    -> efficiently implementing this probably depends on a redesign of SortedShoppingList
    -> first define exactly how this should work! (vanish on click?)


Low priority
------------

- Data synchronisation - part 2:
    1. merge-functionality
    2. two-way auto-sync with merge
    3. [optional] Connect to Google App Folder API / Google App Engine / Amazon Web Services / Dropbox datastore API / something similar (or some of them)
