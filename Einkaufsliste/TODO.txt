TODO
====

- Bug: Small (4 inch) / rotated screen: Main activity too large / not scrollable!
- Bug: Data lost when turning screen while input field (+ keyboard) active
- Suggestion: "Add ingredient to recipe": List very long -> auswählen schwierig. Bessere Variante? (Textsuchemöglichkeit?)
- Focus element when entering activity or set element active (when element expands)

- Data synchronisation between different devices (in the same network?) possible?
    -> Synchronisation between (partial?) data of different users?
    -> Merges of different datasets?
    -> Google App Folder API, Google App Engine, Amazon Web Services, Dropbox datastore API?
