TODO

- db statt json für aktuelle daten (json nur noch für import / export)
    - db: wie sortieren? SQL sort + danach noch spezialsort?
    - Reset db button in settings! (Need to have this also for FS-based, don't I? And an option to switch between storage types!)
    - Ask before overwriting db (e.g. before importing file / resetting db)!

- Use Google Paging Library (https://guides.codepath.com/android/Paging-Library-Guide) to speed up large RecyclerViews?
- Better possibilities for "insert-list" (add *-lists)? Sometimes certain items are hidden by the on-screen keyboard. should still be text searchable
- Save-icon should rather be an export icon (how does this normally look?) The same for import
- Read (+) button sometimes not accessible (on bottom, but not visible and no scrolling possible)

- Alternatives: Könnten diese in der ShoppingList rückgängig-machbar sein (bzw. changeable)?
- Possibility to add a picture to a recipe (-> can I save these in json? Or how to do this technically? Save in db should work, but otherwise?)
- Option in Go Shopping to set marked items as invisible -> add chk_box on the other side of the spinner on top
    -> efficiently implementing this probably depends on a redesign of SortedShoppingList
    -> first define exactly how this should work! (vanish on click?)
