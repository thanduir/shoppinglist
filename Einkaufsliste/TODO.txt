TODO
====

- Look through program (UI) to check for other areas worth improving (esp. small QoL fixes)!

- Decide wether to implement these now (otherwise delete them or move 'em to the list at the bottom):
    - Alternatives: Könnten diese in der ShoppingList rückgängig-machbar sein (bzw. changeable)?
    - Possibility to add a picture to a recipe (-> save them separatly in a folder (export how?). But how / where to show them?)
    - Option in Go Shopping to set marked items as invisible -> add chk_box on the other side of the spinner on top
        -> efficiently implementing this probably depends on a redesign of SortedShoppingList
        -> first define exactly how this should work! (vanish on click?)
    - Further speed improvements for json possible?
    - Make as many db calls as possible async! This might speed things up. In the end i might even be able to unset allowMainThreadQueries
        * Look for slow operations and prioritize them!
        * Importing data seems to take quite a while. -> either speed it up or show a waiting cursor!
        * Can i speed the db backend up with other changes?
    - Decide on which backend should be the default choice!


Ideas for later
