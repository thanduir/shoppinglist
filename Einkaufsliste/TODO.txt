- Better possibilities for "insert-list" (add *-lists)? Sometimes certain items are hidden by the on-screen keyboard. should still be text searchable
    -> list with filter instead of textbox with autocomplete?
- Ingredients:
    * Abtrennung zwischen Buchstaben ("A", dann kommen alle die mit "a" beginnen, dann "B", ...)
    * Can i make the ingredients page text-searchable (i.e. search file that scrolls to the ingredient one is looking for)?
        -> or could i define a filter similar to what will be done for the "insert-list"?

- reset to defaults button to small (for two lines) in german...
- Read (+) button sometimes not accessible (on bottom, but not visible and no scrolling possible)

- Make as many db calls as possible async! This might speed things up. In the end i might even be able to unset allowMainThreadQueries
    * Look for slow operations and prioritize them!
    * Importing data seems to take quite a while. -> either speed it up or show a waiting cursor!
- Make sure both backend implementations are as fast as (reasonably) possible
- Decide on which backend should be the default choice!

- Look through program (UI) to find other areas worth improving!

- Alternatives: Könnten diese in der ShoppingList rückgängig-machbar sein (bzw. changeable)?
- Possibility to add a picture to a recipe (-> save them separatly in a folder (export how?). But how / where to show them?)
- Option in Go Shopping to set marked items as invisible -> add chk_box on the other side of the spinner on top
    -> efficiently implementing this probably depends on a redesign of SortedShoppingList
    -> first define exactly how this should work! (vanish on click?)
