- Possibility to refer to other recipies within a recipe (or a subcategory for "partial recipes")? E.g. Salat within "Pommes + Cordon-Bleu" -> dependencies?
- db statt json für aktuelle daten (json nur noch für import / export)
    - db: wie sortieren? SQL sort + danach noch spezialsort?
    - Reset db button in settings!
    - Ask before overwriting db (e.g. before importing file / resetting db)?

- Possibility to add a picture to a recipe (-> can I save these in json? Or how to do this technically? Save in db should work, but otherwise?)
- Use Google Paging Library (https://guides.codepath.com/android/Paging-Library-Guide) to speed up large RecyclerViews?
- Option in Go Shopping to set marked items as invisible -> add chk_box on the other side of the spinner on top
    -> efficiently implementing this probably depends on a redesign of SortedShoppingList
    -> first define exactly how this should work! (vanish on click?)


Low priority

- Data synchronisation - part 2:
    1. merge-functionality
    2. two-way auto-sync with merge
    3. [optional] Connect to Google App Folder API / Google App Engine / Amazon Web Services / Dropbox datastore API / something similar (or some of them)
