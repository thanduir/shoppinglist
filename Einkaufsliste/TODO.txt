- Use Google Paging Library (https://guides.codepath.com/android/Paging-Library-Guide) to speed up large RecyclerViews?
- db: recipes -> Älplermagronen sind zu unterst in der Liste!
- Better possibilities for "insert-list" (add *-lists)? Sometimes certain items are hidden by the on-screen keyboard. should still be text searchable
- Read (+) button sometimes not accessible (on bottom, but not visible and no scrolling possible)

- Make as many db calls as possible async! This might speed things up. In the end i might even be able to unset allowMainThreadQueries
    * Look for slow operations and prioritize them!
    * Importing data seems to take quite a while. -> either speed it up or show a waiting cursor!
- Make sure both implementations are as fast as (reasonably) possible
- Decide on which backend should be standard!

- Alternatives: Könnten diese in der ShoppingList rückgängig-machbar sein (bzw. changeable)?
- Possibility to add a picture to a recipe (-> save them separatly in a folder (export how?). But how / where to show them?)
- Option in Go Shopping to set marked items as invisible -> add chk_box on the other side of the spinner on top
    -> efficiently implementing this probably depends on a redesign of SortedShoppingList
    -> first define exactly how this should work! (vanish on click?)
