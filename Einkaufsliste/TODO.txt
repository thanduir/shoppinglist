====

- Option in Go Shopping to set marked items as invisible -> add chk_box on the other side of the spinner on top
- data consistency check method (correctness of text-only references, something?) to be executed on loading (and saving?) of json files

- separate java files into several packages (at least GUI / data, keep switch to db in mind when doing this)
- db statt json für aktuelle daten (json nur noch für import / export) -> sollte auch performance stark verbessern...
- Possibility to add a picture to a recipe

- Data synchronisation - part 2:
    1. merge-functionality
    2. two-way auto-sync with merge
    3. [optional] Connect to Google App Folder API / Google App Engine / Amazon Web Services / Dropbox datastore API / something similar (or some of them)
